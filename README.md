## ***MLSeek***
Welcome to my Free and Open Source C++ Library, MLSeek.

The main aim of MLSeek is to open up the previously gatekept domain of Machine Learning in C++.

# *Why create a library?*
Due to majority of the machine learning domain residing in the Python Ecosphere, there is a lack of easy to use Machine Learning libraries in C++.<br>
C++ being my language of choice, I found this fact surprising. Hence, what was initially meant to be a simple library for personal use, transformed into the currently ongoing project called MLSeek.<br>

## Notes:
The Library is in the very early stages of development. Work on the project has been in on-off stages over a period of 1 month currently (balancing college and other projects). A LOT of work is yet to be done.
